# Google-Gift-Card-Is-Scam
Why one should never purchase gift card


Back in 2019, September I went to Infosys Bangalore, India for Internship in Machine Learning. There I had a account with ICICI Banks. And I used that bank account to hook up with Paytm app. Paytm is very useful in India as every vendors etc accept it and it is reliable app also.

I wanted to purchase some apps so I purchased gift card of around 8$. So what I did was opened paytm purchased a gift card. And Paytm sent me the gift card code to my mobile number.

I tried to redeem it but it was saying Please provide more information.


So I filled information. And waited it.

I came back to my country Nepal which is neighbouring country of India. I heard no feedback from google and gift card was still not reddemable. So I called the google support and now they say provide us bills, gift card back photo. 

Oh common I got the gift card from paytm how can I show you gift card photo. And they were asking for cellular bills or utility bills? I said to them I was intern and purchased gift card there I don't have phone number and bank access as Infosys had closed those before I came to my country.

I submiteed forms like 11 times providing screenshot of paytm etc but no they don't reply. They just say due to high volume of cases it can take time.


Imagine if I had purchased 500$ gift card? 

So in conclusion
- I will never purchase any gift card and please you also don't purchase it.
- Google treats people like they are scamming in name of security. Honestly who don't loves free money.
- Google Support is shit. They only follow rules which apply to california US.
- I will never use google service like gmail, google etc.
- Google Play card is modern way to scam people.
